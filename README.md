# SimpleChannelWebApp

Simple web chat where users can switch messages with each other.

When first arriving to the website the user is prompt to select a username.

After choosing the username the user is directed to the channel pages where he can select a channel to enter or create a new one as long as there is no channel with the selected name.

When a user creates a new channel all the other users in the channel page see the new channel immediatly without needing to refresh the page.

Inside a channel page a user can send and receive messages to people on that channel. To receive the messages there is no necessity to refresh the page.

A user can delete his own messages which disappear for everyone.

The server stores only the latest 100 messages of each channel.
